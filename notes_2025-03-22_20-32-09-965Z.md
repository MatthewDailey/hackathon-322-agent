# Oncall Investigation Log - 2025-03-22T20:31

## Issue Description
High latency observed across all endpoints:
- /api/ping: 1.8s
- /api/search: 1.2s 
- Homepage: 2.2s

## Investigation Steps

1. Checked current endpoint health:
   - All endpoints responding but with high latency
   - No error status codes observed

2. Analyzed Render metrics:
   - P99 latency for /api/ping shows dramatic increase starting around 19:54:30Z
   - Latency jumped from ~2ms to ~4000-6000ms
   - Chart saved as latency_chart.png

3. Checked recent changes:
   - Deploy at 19:12:56Z adding LaunchDarkly feature flag integration
   - Multiple feature flag changes for "better-ai-search" flag between 18:55-20:31
   - Most recent deploy was a rollback at 20:14:39Z but latency remains high

## Root Cause
The latency increase correlates with the deployment of LaunchDarkly feature flag integration at 19:12:56Z. While there was an attempt to rollback at 20:14:39Z, the latency issues persist, suggesting either:
1. The rollback was not effective
2. There are residual effects from the feature flag changes

## Recommended Action
Turn off the "better-ai-search" feature flag since the latency started with the LaunchDarkly integration and multiple flag changes have been made.
