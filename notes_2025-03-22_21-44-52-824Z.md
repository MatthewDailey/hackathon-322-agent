# Oncall Investigation Log - 2025-03-22T21:42:38.149Z

## Issue Summary
- High API latency detected (P99 ~4-5s)
- Some 502 errors observed
- Coincides with recent deploy and feature flag changes

## Timeline
- 20:53:57Z: New deploy with "add new better ai search" changes
- 20:53-20:56Z: 502 errors observed
- 21:42Z: Issue detected during oncall check
- 21:43Z: Feature flag "better-ai-search" turned off
- 21:43Z: Attempted rollback (failed)

## Investigation Details

### API Health Check Results
- Ping endpoint: 2.3s response time
- Search endpoint: 2.7s response time
- All endpoints returning 200s but with elevated latency

### Recent Changes
1. Deploy at 20:53:57Z
   - Commit: "add new better ai search (flag=better-ai-search)"
   - Deploy ID: dep-cvfi6p5ds78s73fm4lug

2. Feature Flag Changes
   - Multiple updates to "better-ai-search" flag
   - Flag has been turned off as mitigation

### Metrics
- P99 latency increased from ~3s to ~4-5s after deploy
- Brief spike of 502 errors during deploy window
- Current status: stable but slower than normal

## Actions Taken
1. Notified team of performance degradation
2. Turned off "better-ai-search" feature flag
3. Attempted rollback via API (failed)

## Recommendations
1. Manual rollback needed via Render dashboard
2. Investigate cause of increased latency in new search implementation
3. Add better monitoring for search endpoint performance
