# Incident Report - Search API 500 Errors

## Timeline
- 2025-03-22T20:22:50Z: Deploy with new AI search feature (flag=better-ai-search)
- 2025-03-22T22:52:15Z: Incident detected - Search API returning 500 errors
- 2025-03-22T22:53:00Z: Investigation started
- 2025-03-22T22:54:00Z: Root cause identified - new AI search feature causing errors
- 2025-03-22T22:54:30Z: Mitigation - turned off better-ai-search feature flag
- 2025-03-22T22:55:30Z: Verified service restored - search API returning 200s

## Investigation
1. Initial testing showed search API returning 500 errors
2. Recent deploy found adding new AI search feature behind feature flag
3. LaunchDarkly audit log showed better-ai-search flag was recently enabled
4. Timing of errors correlated with flag enablement

## Resolution
- Turned off better-ai-search feature flag
- Verified search API returned to normal operation
- Search latency back under 2 seconds (1.6s observed)

## Next Steps
1. Development team should investigate AI search implementation
2. Fix bugs in AI search feature
3. Re-enable feature flag once fixed and tested
